    This app is for keeping track of common workflow tasks in school, such as the induction of new students.<br>
    It provides a checklist that that should be checked off as each task is completed.<br>
    When a task is checked off the list is emailed to members of the team so that they may see if they can complete subsequent tasks.<br><br>
